                  service which supplies such information is not a
                  satisfactory solution. Activities of users at
                  terminals and most application programs should
                  remain unaffected when the internal representation
                  of data is changed and even when some aspects of the
                  external representation are changed. Changes in data
                  representation will often be needed as a result of
                  changes in query, update, and report traffic and
                  natural growth in the types of stored

                  systems provide users with tree-structured files or
                  slightly more general network models of the data. In
                  Section 1, inadequacies of these models are
                  discussed. A model based on n-ary relations, a
                  normal form for data base relations, and the concept
                  of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In
                  Section 2, certain operations on relations (other
                  than logical inference) are discussed and applied to
                  the problems of redundancy and consistency in the

  abstract =     {Data analysis applications typically aggregate data
                  across many dimensions looking for unusual
                  patterns. The SQL aggregate functions and the GROUP
                  BY operator produce zero-dimensional or
                  one-dimensional answers. Applications need the
                  N-dimensional generalization of these operators. The
                  paper defines that operator, called the data cube or
                  simply cube. The cube operator generalizes the
                  histogram, cross-tabulation, roll-up, drill-down,
                  and sub-total constructs found in most report
                  writers. The cube treats each of the N aggregation
                  attributes as a dimension of N-space. The aggregate
                  of a particular set of attribute values is a point
                  in this space. The set of points forms an
                  N-dimensionaI cube. Super-aggregates are computed by
                  aggregating the N-cube to lower dimensional
                  spaces. Aggregation points are represented by an
                  "infinite value": ALL, so the point
                  (ALL,ALL,...,ALL, sum(*)) represents the global sum
                  of all items. Each ALL value actually represents the
                  set of values contributing to that aggregation.},

                  combines data gathering, data storage, and knowledge
                  management with analysis to provide input to the
                  decision process. The term originated in 1989; prior
                  to that many of its characteristics were part of
                  executive information systems. Business intelligence
                  emphasizes analysis of large volumes of data about
                  the firm and its operations. It includes competitive
                  intelligence (monitoring competitors) as a
                  subset. In computer-based environments, business
                  intelligence uses a large database, typically stored
                  in a data warehouse or data mart, as its source of
                  information and as the basis for sophisticated
                  analysis. Analyses ranges from simple reporting to
                  slice-and-dice, drill down, answering ad hoc
                  queries, real-time analysis, and forecasting. A
                  large number of vendors provide analysis
                  tools. Perhaps the most useful of these is the
                  dashboard. Recent developments in BI include
                  business performance measurement (BPM),
                  businessactivity monitoring (BAM), and the expansion
                  of BI from being a staff tool to being used by
                  people throughout the organization (BI for the
                  masses). In the long-term, BI techniques and
                  findings will be imbedded into business processes.",

In general, the BC is increasing with connectivity as a power law with an exponent \${\textbackslash}eta\$. We find that for trees or networks with a small loop density \${\textbackslash}eta = 2\$while a larger density of loops leads to \${\textbackslash}eta {\textless} 2\$. For scale-free networks characterized by an exponent \${\textbackslash}gamma\$which describes the connectivity distribution decay, the BC is also distributed according to a power law with a non universal exponent \${\textbackslash}delta\$. We show that this exponent \${\textbackslash}delta\$must satisfy the exact bound \${\textbackslash}delta{\textbackslash}geq ({\textbackslash}gamma + 1)/2\$. If the scale free network is a tree, then we have the equality \${\textbackslash}delta = ({\textbackslash}gamma + 1)/2\$.},
